# Process-Scheduling-Algorithms
A C++ program which implements all the Operating System Process Scheduling Algorithms
  - First Come First Serve (FCFS)
  - Shortest Process Next (SPN or SJF)
  - Shortest Remaining Process Next (SRPN or SRJF)
  - Preemptive Priority
  - Preemptive Round Robin (PRR)



Scheduling_Processes_terminal can be used to run the program on the system terminal by following the mentioned commands:

1) Open the Windows command prompt and come to the appropriate directory.
2) Compile the program (Run command 'g++ Scheduling_Processes_terminal.cpp -o Scheduling_Processes_terminal.exe').
3) The exe file only works for Windows Systems, so for Linux or Mac, make the required file.
4) Run 'Scheduling_Processes_terminal X.txt' where X represents the file name of the required input file.
